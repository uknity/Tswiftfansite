<h1><Biography></h1>
   <br>
   <div>Charging her way through numerous genres and countless dramas, Taylor Swift is an American singer, songwriter, and icon, setting an example for young girls, teens, and middle-aged women alike.  Swift was born in 1989 in West Reading, Pennsylvania.  Her parents worked in finance, but supported her immensely in her early musical efforts.  Inspired by Shania Twain and Faith Hill, Swift turned to country music and began writing and playing her own songs.  Her family relocated to Nashville when she was 14 years old to pursue her musical talents.

    Despite the profuse, dense talent in Nashville, Swift shined, drawing the attention of fans and record labels.  At 16, she became the youngest recipient of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007. In 2008, Swift had fans crooning to her lead single, "Love Story."
    
    Swift continued putting out numerous albums mostly written about her personal life.  She emerged into the pop world with the album, Red, and built her empire around pop albums like 1989, Reputation, and Lover.  She earned record-setting accolades along the way including ACM's Female Vocalist of the Year, CMT's Video of the Year for "Love Story," MTV's Video Music Award for Best Female Video for "You Belong With Me," 10 Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, seven Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards, and 23 Billboard Music Awards.  Swift was named Time's 100 most influential people 5 different years, Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, and Billboard's Woman of the Decade.</div>
